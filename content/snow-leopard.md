Well I got Snow Leopard. I was excited at first cause I was thinking of the great features. After installing it I realized that I did not really get much. Now I am sure my thoughts are going to change real fast. I do like that Quicktime X has a screen recorder. That saves me from having to buy one. In a few days I want to write up a detailed pro and cons of Leopard. I need to use it for a few days so I can give a better review.

Oh I found a good website that shows the applications that run good, somewhat good, and not at all with Snow Leopard. [http://snowleopard.wikidot.com/](http://snowleopard.wikidot.com/)
