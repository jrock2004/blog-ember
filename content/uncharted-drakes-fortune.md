Yesterday a friend of mine let me borrow a games for the Playstation 3 called [Uncharted Drakeâ€™s Fortune](http://www.us.playstation.com/uncharted/) . Now I do realize that this game is not new but I will tell you my opinion about it has changed. When I first looked at this game I thought that this was Tomb Raider rebuilt. Well it kinda is but the graphics are better and so is the game play. I have not gotten far in the game but it is good as of now.

Controls are not that bad. I thought it was going to be tuff. Camera angles are pretty good but sometimes they are not that good. If you have not played this game it would be a good pickup or even a rental.
