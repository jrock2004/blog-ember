Today I went to a [Zenoss training](http://www.zenoss.com/support/training) in Baltimore MD. This is a training that usually costs around $1500 USD to attend. They are offering this one day training session for **free**. As soon as I heard this I said where do you sign me up. Of course I have a 2 hour drive in rush hour to get to inner harbor but I will tell you it is worth it. So I thought I would share some highlights and my thoughts about how this training went.

**Traveling** Well according to [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) , it would take me about an hour and half. With traffic believe it or not it only took about 2 hours. The hotel was easy to find and parking was not expensive at all.

**Training Itself** Well lets get to the reason why you are reading this blog post. I really liked this training. The slide show presentation was done well. It started off by explaining the backend and how Zenoss works. Then they got into each section and explain how they work. I did feel it went a little fast but we only had so many things to cover is such a little time. There were a few questions which kinda took us off course, but the trainers got it back on track really fast. The only con I had from the whole thing was the amount of time we had. Due to this we really could not drill down on certain things. The trainers did a great job in explaining the basic to give you the idea on how it works. I am very interested in possibly taken the paid training. Honestly if you have an opportunity to attend one of these you should. It is worth the traveling time and any feels involved.

**Gifts** When I got there they had a bag of gifts to give everyone. I got a 4GB pen drive, a pen, Zenoss sticker, Zebra stress toy, and a Zenoss shirt. They also provided a great lunch. Thanks again to Zenoss team. Take a look at [their website](http://www.zenoss.org/) for more information on the product.
