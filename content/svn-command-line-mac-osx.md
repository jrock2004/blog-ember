In one of my previous tutorials I showed you how to setup an [SVN server](http://oldblog.dev/blog/2009/09/14/svn-command-line-mac-osx/blog/2009/09/03/setup-svn-server/). So now that is setup I am sure your next question is how do I use it. In the Mac realm there is limited access to how to communicate with an SVN. In this tutorial I am going to show you how to use Terminal to work with your SVN repository. So I created a folder in my users directory called Development.

```
cd Development
mkdir myWebsite
svn co http://ipaddressofserver/svn/myWebsite myWebsite
```

So now if you view the myWebsite directory you will see any files that are in the SVN directory. So now you will want to create a file and put some text in there. This can be anything from web files, images, executables, etcâ€¦ Then when you are ready go back to the terminal and do the following:

```
cd Development
svn commit myWebsite -m "You would put some sort of message to explain what you are updating" --username jcostanzo
```

And that is pretty much it to command line work with SVN. There are tons more information about SVN command line. This is just the basics to get you started.
