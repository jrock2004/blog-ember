Well I have decided to jump back into Java programming due to some recent events. I went out and bought [Sams Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours](http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Java-Hours/dp/0672330768/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1270148003&amp;sr=1-1) to help me in this journey. So to help me grasp the material I wanted to create blog posts/tutorials to help me and to help others who might be on this same goal.

Oh and the two things that you will not see the void main for is applets and servlets. Here is the source code of the file I created

``` javascript
class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
      String sayHello = "Hello, World!";
      String myName = "John Costanzo";
      int myAge = 28;
      boolean theTruth = false;
      System.out.println(sayHello + " My name is " + myName);
      System.out.println("Is my age " + myAge + "?nThe answer is " + theTruth);
  }
}
```
