Since [posting my tutorial](http://jcwebconcepts.net/web-server-ubuntu-9-10) on running a web server on Ubuntu 9.10, I have had some questions on some of the next steps. So in this tutorial I want to discuss what you want to do to get your web server on the internet. I want to discuss on how to set it that a standard user can edit files in the web directory.
