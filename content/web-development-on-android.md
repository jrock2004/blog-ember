One of my latest purchases was an Android Samsung Galaxy Tablet 10.1. Unfortunately I have to get a replacement but it happens. So getting back on track I am new to an Android device. I found a great app on the Google Play Store, called [Terminal IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spartacusrex.spartacuside&feature=search_result) . This app brings you access to the terminal and you have some nice commands to work with. A few to name is, Git, VIM, find, etcâ€¦ Once I get my tablet back I will do a video demo to show it off.
