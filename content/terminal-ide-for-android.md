I just purchased a [Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-10-1-Inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B007M50PTM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1339511679&sr=8-1) and I am loving it. So since I am new I have been looking around for some good apps to use. I think I found one in an app called [Terminal IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spartacusrex.spartacuside&hl=en) . This application brings a developmenting environment with Git support that I can do some web development work with it. I am not going to say I can replace my desktop or a laptop, but you can do some quick fixes with it. A good accessory to get with it is the [Logitech bluetooth keyboard](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Tablet-Keyboard-Android-920-003390/dp/B0054L8N7M/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1339512202&sr=1-1) . You will have to let me know in the comments below on what you think about this nice application.
