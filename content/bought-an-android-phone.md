I finally took the plunge and converted from iPhone to Android. I just bought the Samsung Galaxy S3. I guess buying the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 has made me make the change. It could also be due to the changes that are rumored for the iPhone 5. I have owned it for few days and so far I am liking it. In the following weeks I would like to post on how I am doing things that I use to do with my iPhone. I have read a few of these blog posts, but I am sure some would love to hear my perspective.
