So I have been thinking that it may be time for me to learn another programming language. I have thought for some time now and since I have switched to Mac I think it might be cool to program apps for it. I know what would I program? What would I get from learning it. Then I though what about Linux applications. I work in an environment that uses Linux computers. My knowledge of [GUI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical User Interface") programming is very slim. I took VB a long time ago. Lastly I thought about iPhone programming. The only issue here is that I would have to apply and pay for a developers kit and hope Apple would give it to me.

So this is what I ponder. What will I do. Do you guys have any thoughts?
