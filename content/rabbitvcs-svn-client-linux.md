If you have used SVN in the past in the Windows world, you are probably pretty use too TortoiseSVN. It is a nice tool that integrates itself into the Windows shell. In the Linux world you probably were using the command line to do these things. Hey I understand I was doing that on my work computer when it was running Linux. I have something in Linux that will get rid of this. RabbitVCS is a client that integrates itself into Nautilus. It is pretty close to being a clone to Tortoise and I really like it.
