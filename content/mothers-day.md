So sitting here as my wife is celebrating her first mothers, I was curious what is the true meaning of Mother’s Day. I am thinking this cause it appears that Mother’s Day is the day that the husband has to be a slave to his wife. You buy them a gift or 2. So I was looking on wikipedia website and I found a except about the original meaning of the holiday.

A common early activity was the meeting of groups of mothers whose sons had fought or died on opposite sides of the [American Civil War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") . So I am sure I am going to be hated but it appears that this should not really be celebrated but it should be a day of reflecting on the mothers who lost a love one in war. I hope I will not be targeted by woman for this.

The article I was reading from was here on [wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/ywn8k8).
