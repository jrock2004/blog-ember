So since I am going to go to this Linux User Group meeting I thought I might have to get back into having an Linux OS. Now I am running Mac but hey I should have some form of Linux. Before I had a Mac I would run Linux with a distribution called Gentoo . Now I am sure you might say what is the difference?

Well there are different types of Distributions unlike Windows or Mac. Some are easy and some are more challenging. For beginners I would expect you them to try something like Ubuntu . Gentoo on the other hand is a little more difficult to use. You have to make more choices than other distroâ€™s but in the long run it is better.
