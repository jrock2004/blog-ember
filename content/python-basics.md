If you have been reading previous blog posts, I have been using a monitoring tool called [Zenoss](http://www.zenoss.com/). Under the hood there is a lot of [Python](http://www.python.org/) stuff. So I decided to start learning Python. Python can run on Mac, Linux, Unix, and Windows. Let me show you some basic on what you can do in python.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/python  

firstName = "John"
lastName = "Costanzo"

# Lets just print out one variable
print firstName

# Now lets complete my name
print firstName, lastName

# Lets just print something random without a variable
print "The sun is warm. The grass is green"

# Now I will print some variables followed by some text
print firstName, lastName, "Is the owner of this blog."
```

For more information on Python you can visit [this site](http://docs.python.org/).
