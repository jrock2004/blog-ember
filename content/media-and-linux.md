This is part 6 of my using Linux for everything blog posts. Some time ago, if you wanted to listen to music or watch videos, you ran into issues. Todayâ€™s Linux has changed all that. Honestly the only issues I have had is that my iTunes purchased content cannot be played. This is hugh since I do a lot of purchasing of music on iTunes. If you do not use iTunes then this is not an issue. So with this being said I would say that I could not make the switch to Linux fully since I would lose the ability to watch my movies and listen to my music. Maybe someday this block will not be here.
