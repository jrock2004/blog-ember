So I finally converted all my posts and they are back into Wordpress. So now you are probably asking yourself, what is next? Is this site going to go dormant again? The answer is, no I am not going dormant again. Here is the list of things on my TODO list

1. Find a better temp theme
2. Add some Wordpress plugins to enhance the experience
3. Build my own theme because, well, I am a web dev and I should have my own made theme
4. Make some more tutorials on web development
