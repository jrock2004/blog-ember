Well this past week Adobe has launched their new cloud service called, [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html) . As of launch they are charging a monthly fee of $49.99 and I believe it is going to be well worth it. I will gladly pay that amount to get all of the Adobe products for both Windows and Mac. So lets say you wanted to buy a master collection copy of Adobe for both OSâ€™es, you would be paying 2599.99 per OS. Yep that would cost you $5199.98 and that is for the current version. When a new version comes out you can pay and upgrade rate but still pay.

So with doing some simple math here, 5199.98/49.99=104. That would be almost 9 years to get what I would have paid for one version. I think I will gladly take that. I will let you guys decide but right now I think that is pretty much a steal. Thoughts?
