Well as a PHP, HTML, CSS, and jQuery designer one of the things I have been looking for is a good lightweight text editor. I have used many different types of editors and not found the right one. When I programmed in Windows I loved [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/), but there is no Mac/Linux equivalent. The editors that I have used in the past are as follows:

- [NVU](http://net2.com/nvu/)
- [Dreamweaver](http://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver/)
- [VIM](http://www.vim.org/)
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
- [Bluefish](http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/)
    
    The last editor I was and still will use is VIM. There is times I just want to click somewhere to move my cursor, I.E. Being lazy. I really like bluefish cause it is very lightweight and fast. Eclipse and Dreamweaver just are too slow for me. Bluefish will work in Mac, Linux, and Windows. The best thing I like about it, is it is free. So take a look at them, post some comments about what you think is the best. Maybe you have one that I just have not seen.
