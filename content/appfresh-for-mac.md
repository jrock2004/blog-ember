For all you users out there that are Mac guys like me, there is an app called [AppFresh](http://metaquark.de/appfresh/) . This application is a tool that will scan for your 3rd party apps that you have installed. It will then look on the internet to see if there is an update for them. What I like it before it does that it sends the current version to the trash so if the update is bad you can go back to the original version.

So I basically use the system update tool for the OS and then I use AppFresh to update all my 3rd party stuff.
