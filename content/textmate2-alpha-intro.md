So the other day, it was announced that the alpha release of TextMate2 was avaliable for licensed users of [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) So I decided to make a little video on some of the changes that I have seen so far. I am excited what I have seen and look forward in helping making TextMate the best editor around.
