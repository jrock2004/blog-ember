Setting up a new computer can be a tedious and tiresome process. I am not the person that has an exact image of my machine, so when things go wrong I just load that image. I would never have something like that because when I am ready to re-install, I want to start as clean as possible.

At some point I went ahead and starting backing up my [dotfiles in Github](https://github.com/jrock2004/dotfiles/tree/f5a74186a1b33005c23d20595a7731620697e5ed). This starting to make things easier but it was still a problem. I still had to install all the apps I needed to do things. Then the problem was, what and how do I install these things again. So then I watched a video by another developer by the name of [Nick Nisi](https://github.com/nicknisi). He built a script to not only get his dotfiles but also it started moving things to where they need to be. Take a look at the video below where I talk a little more about this topic. [You can view my current dotfiles here](https://github.com/jrock2004/dotfiles).
