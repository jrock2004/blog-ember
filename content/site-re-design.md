For the next few weeks I will be working on a new Wordpress theme. I will post when it is complete so please do not judge my themes till I get it at 100% I was thinking that I might setup a test environment to test on since Wordpress really does not have a tool to check your theme before you make it live.

I guess if anyone has an opinion on how to test a theme before making it live then post a comment or hit me up on twitter [@jrock2004](http://twitter.com/jrock2004 "@jrock2004")
