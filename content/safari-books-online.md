Well in past I have always wanted to use this service and never did. [Safari Books Online](http://www.safaribooksonline.com/) is a service that you pay a monthly fee. Now what this service does for you is it gives you a hugh selection of computer books. They range from programming to Operating Systems. Now if you are like me I like to buy books almost every month and read them. Then they go in a bookshelf to collect dust unless there is some reason I might need it again. So go ahead and get a subscription. It is well worth it.
