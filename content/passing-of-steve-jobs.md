As many bloggers have already done, we have lost someone this past week that was dear to a lot of Mac fanboys. He will be missed but I am sure he was working on his successor for a long time. I wonder how many people added to their Netflix queue, “Pirates of Silicon Valley”? As I am sure everything in that movie had some things that did not happen, Steve gained my respect. So good luck Steve to where ever the road takes you. Good bye.
