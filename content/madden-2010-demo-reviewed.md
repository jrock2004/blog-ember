Well I just finished playing my first game of Madden 2010. I was shocked cause I thought the gang tackling would have happened all the time. The animations of the crowd got a little boring. I like that when a player fumbled you have to hit the keys to fight for the ball. I thought the defense was a little difficult. I am glad about that. They really slowed the game down which is ok I guess. One of the things I did not like was players were breaking tackles they were not capable of. Hope that gets fixed. One of the best things I like is the QB throwing motion. If you wait too long your arm might get batted or a sack. Tackling is awesome except the break tackle but other wise it is great. As of now I give this game an A grade.
