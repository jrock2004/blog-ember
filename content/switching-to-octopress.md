I have decided to leave the world of Wordpress, for the world of [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) . I will have some tutorials on this blogging framework but there are some reasons I made this change. I think the biggest reason I changes was Octopress does not use a database. To me that is just a great performance boost. The application comes with some nice plugins like twitter, Github, and Google+.

Using one command like rake deploy, and it automatically pushes the compiled static content to my web server with [1and1](http://www.1and1.com/?affiliate_id=195911) via rsync. I no longer have to login to an admin panel and use a bloated tool like Wordpress has. I can open vim or TextMate and start writing my post using Markdown. So go try it out. I think you guys and gals will love it.
