With my hosting package with 1and1 I get 2 free domain names. So I used 1 domain for my blog here and the other for my portfolio. Today I decided why not use one and put my work as pages and my tutorials as blog posts. Maybe this is not the best idea. So I might decide to go back to using the other for something else.
