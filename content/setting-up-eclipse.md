I wanted to talk about how to setup your Eclipse IDE to work with Selenium, Maven, and TestNG. For those who do not know what those are you can click on the link to learn more. I will be making some more posts/tutorials on how to use these items. Eclipse can run on Mac, Linux, and or Windows. You need to have Java installed and if you want to work with SVN then you need the command line SVN client. From the video below here is the list of the sites that you will need to add to Eclipse:

- Maven = [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e](http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e)
- TestNG = [http://beust.com/eclipse](http://beust.com/eclipse)
- Subclipse = [http://subclipse.tigris.org/update\_1.6.x](http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x)
