Today an employee at my job requested that I install an application called FreeMind . FreeMind is an application that you can take your ideas and organize them. I use it for time and project management.

What is cool is you can export your map to an image, PDF or HTML. This tool can be used for other things but this is my first day using this. So I will keep using this and see if I can find some cons.
