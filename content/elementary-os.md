So some of my Twitter followers have started to talk up, using a Linux OS called [ElementaryOS](http://elementary.io). Its suppose to give you the look and feel of OSX. So after some many tweets, I have decided to install this in Virtualbox and give this a look over to see if its possible to replace my Windows/Mac environment. I have used Linux before, mostly and Arch/Ubuntu guy. So lets dig in and talk about some of things I liked and disliked.

## Installer

As soon as the GUI came up for the installer I could feel the Ubuntu. Now there is nothing wrong with this at all. The install went very smooth and had no issues going through it

## Playing Around

Got to say after logging in, I really liked the look. You can instantly tell that this is a nicely themed Gnome desktop manager. I love the keyboard remapping to open the application menu to Win key + spacebar. The dock at the bottom makes it look like a Mac desktop

## Terminal

I really like the font and theme of the terminal application.

## The Ugly

So there were some ugly things that came up The performance in Virtualbox was not good at all. Maybe this OS is just destine to not be virtualized.

## TheÂ Verdict

I want to install this as a main OS and try to drive this and see how it goes. It has potential but really want to see how it works when you have a retina and non-retina display. That has been my biggest issue with all Linux distro. The support for multiple different DPI screens is a challenge to work with
