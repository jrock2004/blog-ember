As a web developer I find that I write some code that I reuse and or have to write and copy and paste a few times. Well with this addon I use with TextMate called [Zen Coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/ "Zen Coding Google site") , I can save time. Take a look at their site for some good information.
