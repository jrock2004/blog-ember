Have you ever had to learn multiple programming languages are once? I am not talking about HTML and CSS at the same time. I am talking about lets say PHP and AJAX. Well I have too and let me tell you it is tough. Now I do have a grasp on PHP where I am in the advance level. But still it is hard. Now I am really not a fan of the JavaScript language. I cannot understand the concept. I have tried and I have read multiple books but I just cannot get JavaScript. Does anyone have any tips for me? Can someone help me with this task? If can thank you very much.
