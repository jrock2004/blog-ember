This is part 4 of my using Linux for everything blog posts. As of right now my main job is writing Selenium automation using Java and my side job is web development. So could Linux handle all of this with no issues. The answer is no and I will tell you why. As a web developer selenium developer I need to test sometimes against Internet Explorer and or Safari. You can look in my previous post to read the reasons to why this is not possible for me to emulate. Other than that I can install Eclipse and Java in Linux with no issues. So writing my code I can be in Linux. Web developing in Linux I again have no issues. I can pull up VIM and I will be just fine. Even though I might miss TextMate since I have recently fell in love with it.
