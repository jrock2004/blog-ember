As an automation developer, I have learned how to write code in Java. When I am having an issue, one of the nice things that you can do is debug your code, line by line. For the longest I had wished that something like this existed in PHP. I have come to find out that you can actually debug code, like I do in Java. This is such a helpful task because I do not have to waste time using var\_dump and such on variables or results. In your apache/php server you need to install and or enable something called [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) . I will work on a tutorial on how to use xdebug while writing code in Sublime Text 2. So keep an eye out on my blog and or [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/jrock20041) channel for this tutorial.
