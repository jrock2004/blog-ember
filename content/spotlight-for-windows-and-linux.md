One of the nice features in MacOSX is the use of Spotlight. I hardly use icons anymore and just hit command+space and type what I need. While I am in Gentoo or Windows XP, I sorely miss this functionality. Well today I started to look and found a nice tool called [Launchy](http://www.launchy.net/) .

This tool supports skinning and plugins to enhance the already nice tool. What is nice is by default I can do math in it like I can do in spotlight. When I want to call the tool I hit alt+space and it comes up. I will continue to play with this tool but so far I love it.
