[Blogofile](http://www.blogofile.com/) is a simple blogging engine that brings something nice without the use of a database. I have been testing this out and I am starting to like this. I have even been thinking of replacing it with this. I am really enjoying this framework. Go ahead and watch this video below. After the video I will post the step by step instructions just in case you do not want to watch how to do it.
