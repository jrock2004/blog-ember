So this is part 3 of my replace Linux everywhere blog. In this part we will be discussing web browsing. So looking at browsers the only major browser that is not in Linux is Internet Explorer. Now yes I could install [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/ "Winehq") or some other emulator to solve this. But this is not going to solve this issue. Using Wine there is something in me that states are we really seeing Internet Explorer. Now the only reason I need internet explorer is for work. With me at the time doing QA work I need to test the quality of a website in Internet Explorer. Now to be honest I have the same issue in Mac so Linux is not alone here.

So, is there something I am missing here? Is there an solid option that would allow me to get the real Internet Explorer experience? Look forward to hearing your comments.
