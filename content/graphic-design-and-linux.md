This is part 5 of my using Linux for everything blog posts. As a web developer I started to use Photoshop. As I started to use Linux I realized that I could not use Photoshop to its fullest. So I then heard of GIMP. It is a nice tool and it can get the job done. I just did not like the interface that came with it. I also missed some features that were in photoshop. As GIMP has grown it has started to become an app I could see myself using. So for this part I would feel comfortable switching to pure Linux.
