I am starting to develop my own World Of Warcraft website. You are probably asking me why am I doing this? Well when I was playing it was hard to find help about the game. I am not talking about how to solve a particular quest or raid. I am talking about how to make a particular build of a Paladin or a Mage. I want to share how you are suppose to dress your character. So I will post again on this when the skeleton site is up. If you have an recommendations please leave a comment.
