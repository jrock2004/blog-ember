In yesterdays blog I was talking about screen recording. And of course donâ€™t you know it I found a free one that I really like. It is still new but it does what I need and I happy about that. The name of the app is called [Berio](http://www.juniortan.com/Public/Berio.html).

It is very basic with really no preferences. It records your whole screen with no option at this time to do just part of the screen. So I will have to probably use Adobe After Effects to crop just the parts I need when I would not want to record my whole screen. But for free I really cannot complain. I am even thinking of donating if they have that option.
