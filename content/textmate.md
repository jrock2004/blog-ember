As a web developer one of the things you look for is a good editor to use to code your projects. When I was using Windows I would use and app called [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) which was an awesome editor. When I switched to a mac finding an editor was a little difficult. Well I believe I have found it. [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) is the app that had what I was looking for. As I am still learning it I have fallen in love with this application. It is not free but it is well worth it. I am even writing this blog post in it and able to upload it right to my blog all from TextMate. It is not free but it is well worth it. All the plugins which are called bundles make it easy for you to customize the app to you liking.

In a future post I will have some video on how to do things in TextMate. So stay tuned and thanks.
