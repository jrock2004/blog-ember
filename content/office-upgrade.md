So, when I moved into our new house 3 yrs ago, my only requirement was I have my own office. In my last house I was stuck in the basement. When I made videos, I would get the jokes about living in my moms basement. As you can see, all the cords where just all over the place. It was just so bad.

So after I had some back problems, I tied my hand at a standing desk at work. It was nice to have as it helped when my back go stiff. Then I started to work from home more often and at home I do not have one. So I decided it was time to get one. I ordered it and then I decided to re-arrange the office.

So not only did I get an [motor operated one](https://www.autonomous.ai/smartdesk-sit-to-stand-height-adjustable-standing-desk), I also decided it was time to hide the cables as well. So now its nicely tied and tucked away.
