There is a toy that my little girl Lucia loves to listen too. It winds up and plays Mozart pieces. One day as I was turning it to make it play it broke. You should have seen the look on Lucia face when this happened. It looked like she was saying, “Daddy what happened.” So the other day I decided why not take a picture of this thing and post it on [Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/ "Craigslist") .

So I posted it in the wanted section and that evening I got an email that someone has one and will sell it to me. So tonight I will go pick it up and surprise me little girl with one.
