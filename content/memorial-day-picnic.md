Well today is the day we celebrate for our veterans who have died in war. My wife and I decided to have the picnic at our house. We are going to use are new grill to cook hamburgers and hotdogs. I am just glad that we can get family together and celebrate. I wish my family from Buffalo could be here. Cooking on the grill was not too bad. The first time around I did not cook the hamburgers right. I think my issue is I have the flame on high and it burns the outside so I think they are done when they are not in the inside. Well everyone is still alive. After that we played some Lasso golf. I will tell you it is hard to setup but it is a fun game. Overall it was a good day
