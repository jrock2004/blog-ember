Well it appears that Apple has released the next version of the iPhone/ iPod Touch software. I have played around with the new software and for us first generation users there are some updates. One of the things Apple has done is integrate Genius into the app store. So in other words you can view what Genius thinks you would like in their App store. Basically it looks to see what applications you have and then will inform you of some other applications you might like. Now there are other things that the update has done but with having the 1st gen iPhone I cannot see them. To get a complete list visit [Appleâ€™s website](http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/) .
