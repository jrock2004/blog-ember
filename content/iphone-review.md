Well coming from the 1st Gen iPod Touch it is a relief to have the iPhone. Now the version I got was the one with EDGE and not 3g. So far I have not noticed a slowness in EDGE. Now I know this is due to not using 3G but it works for me. It is nice that I now do not need to use a headset to listen to music, movies, or YouTube. I am enjoying the applications that I could not use with my iPod. So far the only con I have seen is the mail sound is really low and can be hard to hear with it in my case. The camera quality is an upgrade compared to my cell phone pictures. I will keep you updated on what is going on with the iPhone.
