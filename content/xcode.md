Well I have been looking at an application for the Mac call [Xcode](http://developer.apple.com/TOOLS/xcode/) . With this application you can create applications for the Mac and the iPhone/iPod Touch. There might be more but at this time I am not aware since I am just starting. So the reason I want to get into this is cause I think it would be cool to make some of my webpages an app that can go on the iPhone or a my Macs. So I will post a part 2 of this with more information.

If anyone has any tips or good sites that can help me with this please post a comment. Thanks.
