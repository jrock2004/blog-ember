I thought I would give an update on what is going on with me learning how to code. My resume has been getting beefed up. So now what I comfortably know how to program in is the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- PHP

I have tried to learn JavaScript but I am not comfortable to put that on the list. I also have messed with Action Script. I am working on getting Ajax on the list. I can do some minor stuff with it but not yet comfortable with putting that on the list. After Ajax since that is needed to know for work purposes, I was looking to finish doing Java. I have a fellow church member who codes Java for a living and what he has talked about has gotten me excited to learn that. I would like to learn a GUI programming language so I can make cross platform applications. Well as always if you have some tips or tricks for me to help me on my journey I would love to hear them.
