I might be doing a demo or training and I will get the question of, what do I use. So this page is going to be the place I can point people to see what I am using and where to get it.

# Editor + Terminal + Fonts

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) is the main editor I use on a daily basis.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) every once in awhile or if I have merge conflicts I will use it. 
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com) is the main terminal I use. [Configuration for iTerm](https://github.com/jrock2004/dotfiles#iterm) can be found on my dotfiles readme
- [Dank Mono](https://www.thefontsmaster.com/download-dank-mono-2-fonts/) is the main font I use for developing.
- [FiraCode Nerd Font Mono](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) is the font I setup as my non-ASCII font in iTerm.

# Desktop Apps

- I use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) everyday to open my apps that I am going to use. I use it as my calculator as well when I need to do math.
- For password management I use [1Password](https://1password.com).
- My main browser I use is Safari, but I have Firefox and Chrome installed to do cross browser testing and when I need a special dev tools utility that does not work in Safari
- My markdown editor that I use to take notes for work and other things is called [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248?mt=12).
- I am not huge when it comes to journaling but when I do, I go to [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com).
